        <h1>The Rocky Road to Bisexuality: A Note From a Lesbian In Love With a Man</h1>
        <h4>by Reese Hausman</h4>
        <p>The concept of a labeled identity seemed safe, secure, like a dotted ‘i’ or crossed ‘t’— until someone came along and flipped everything I thought to be true about myself on its head. Many queer people in the U.S. share the experience of discovering their bisexuality later on in life, whether it comes after a catalyst event or as a slow, creeping realization. Some choose to embrace that label, while others prefer not to put any sticker on their sexuality. In this archive, I aim to collect stories similar to mine, as a not-straight (probably bisexual) woman, share them with an audience of other questioning queer people, and investigate the harmful stigmas the LGBTQ+ community perpetuates about bisexuality that hinder queer people from embracing their identity.</p>

                <h3>Neither Snobs nor Opportunists: An Analysis of Bisexuality through the Experiences of Young Bisexual Women</h3>
                <p>Aurrekoetxea-Casaus et al. discuss concrete statistics and research related to the marginalization that specifically young bisexual cis white women face. The authors aimed to investigate how women construct their bisexuality and address claims that bisexual women are confused, promiscuous, and that their bisexuality does not hold weight within the queer community. Research found that acceptance plays a key part in claiming bisexuality— constructing an identity consists of encountering problems, suffering through them, resolving them, and, finally, coming to terms with the result of that experience. Such barriers to acceptance often include social pressure to conform to cisheteronormativity, the stereotype that the inability to “choose” a gender to have sex with makes bisexuals “sexual opportunists,” and that stigmas assume that bisexuality is nothing more than a transitional identity. I encourage readers who base their knowledge on logic to find solace in this article, as it can help to see concrete numbers associated with what we’re feeling. As the article says, the best way to expedite acceptance is to join a like-minded community.</p>

                <h3>Female Bisexuality from Adolescence to Adulthood: Results from a 10-Year Longitudinal Study</h3>
                <p>In her article, Diamond reviews results from a 10-year longitudinal study involving how nonheterosexual women’s sexualities change or stay the same over time, considering factors such as education, family life, socioeconomic status, etc. Findings show that bisexuality did not persist as a transitional stage en route to lesbianism; instead, bisexual women were more likely to switch between an unlabelled and a bisexual label, and the overall number of women holding those identities did not decline. In fact, about half of the total respondents changed their label at least once, supporting the idea that fluid identities are more common than stable ones. I recommend Diamond’s article to those questioning an unlabeled label, as, personally, I found it reassuring to see the statistics on how women’s identities evolve, straying more toward being unlabeled than away from it, “representing patterns of ‘almost-but-not-quite-exclusive’ same-sex attractions that women may consider inconsistent with both lesbian and bisexual labels.”</p>

                <h3>An Intersectional Analysis of Black Bisexual Men’s Internalized Stigmas</h3>
                <p>Gay & Thomas explore how Black bisexual men experience internalized stigmas, specifically through the lens of how these negative thoughts detriment their mental health. Their findings derive from online discussions held between and authored by Black bisexual men in LGBTQ+ spaces, conversing about topics like colonialism, hypermasculinity, mass incarceration, Christianity, family, etc. Gay & Thomas reinforce these forum posts with further academic research, culminating in a discussion about the roots of stigmas faced by Black bisexual men across multiple levels of society. The researchers assert that Black bisexual men experience gender role conflict differently from Black gay men or White bisexuals: “Black men who have sex with men and women tend to display hypermasculinity to off put any stigma related to perceived femininity within the Black community.” I suggest Gay & Thomas’ article to queer people who want to observe how their sexuality interacts with other oppressions they face, especially from the colloquial tone of social media posts. </p>

                <h3>Development of Bisexual Identity</h3>
                <p>In their article, Gómez & Ysamary evaluate a small sample size of bisexual Venezuelans through a series of in-depth conversations about the participants’ innermost worlds, and observing how bisexual identities develop. They break the development of bisexuality into six stages, including confusion, obstacles, experimentation, commodification, acknowledgement, and acceptance. By interspersing interview quotes throughout the text, the researchers directly compare and contrast different participants’ bisexual experiences and affirm those quotes with academic research. I found this article particularly interesting to read due to its reflection of the raw human psyche, as reflected in this quote: “...that’s when I said I am gay and that’s it, nothing is wrong, move on, and then I liked this woman and it was like what the fuck is happening?” I endorse this article for its portrayal of very different bisexual people’s life experiences that coincide to form sensical umbrella stages. Read their experiences, compare them with yours, see which stage you fit into, and think about how recognizing your current mindset changes your journey of self-discovery. </p>

                <h3>Coming to Terms</h3>
                <p>Suresha’s journal illustrates a turbulent story of self-discovery, revealing how factors like stereotypes and shame shaped his strict view of his own and others’ sexualities. In the beginning, Suresha found it difficult to understand his homosexuality due to the connotation of the word in his local community— to Suresha, being homosexual meant dressing up in drag, not being attracted to men. He would continue to misconstrue labels throughout his young adult life, learning the term “bisexual” from predatory men in the moments before they took advantage of him. Even as Suresha felt attracted to women, he didn’t feel secure experimenting beyond his established homosexual identity until well into his adulthood, when he moved to the “relaxed” city of New Orleans. By assigning stereotypes, whether it be that bisexuals are secretive, not queer enough, or otherwise not valid as an identity, the LGBTQ+ community does a disservice to itself. I urge readers to reflect on the meaning they assign to “bisexual,” exploring any existing negative opinions and where those stem from. </p>

                <h3>Capital B, Capital F</h3>
                <p>In the second chapter of her book, Cooper discusses her tumultuous feminist journey as it aligns with her experiences with race and interracial friendships. Her feminist lens only began to widen when she researched the history of Black feminism and formed meaningful connections with other Black girls. Although Cooper doesn’t explicitly define herself as bisexual, she writes, “The thing I know today, after many cycles of homegirls, many more years of girl crushes, and a life of straight sexual activity, is that one can’t truly be a feminist if you don’t really love women. And loving women deeply and unapologetically is queer as fuck” (20). I recommend Cooper’s book for queer folk who find strong interplay between their intersectional identities. For example, Cooper writes how mothers teach Black girls to distrust women, how that distrust makes female friendships difficult, and finally how the scarcity of deep female friendships persuades women to view their (even platonic) love for other women as “queer and wrong.” </p>

                <h3>Beyond Bisexuality</h3>
                <p>In her article, Dobinson, an MA in Sociology and a hobbyist writer, asserts that sexuality should not be labeled because of its fluidity and basis on subconscious desire. Dobinson writes that sexuality concerns itself with more than just gender preference— it encompasses a web of sexual dichotomies that range from committed/casual to vanilla/kink. She aligns with this concept likely due to the repeated presence of multi-gender non-monogamous relationships in her life, claiming that her “sexual orientation is towards pleasure and the continued exploration and fulfilment of my desire.” The driving factor of her sexuality, therefore, shifts away from gender and towards her need for multiple sexual partners. Her article also contains many references to esteemed gender theorists, such as Judith Butler, and I implore anyone also in “identity limbo” to read Dobinson’s short takeaways from these larger texts about identity disruption.</p>

                <h3>Bisexual Author Talks about ‘Road’ to Self-Discovery.</h3>
                <p>In her newspaper article, Matti talks to David Matteson about how his bisexuality intertwines with his religion, marriage, and his perspective on binary options. While the practice of Christian religious ideology has a conservative reputation, Matteson’s social action church actually helped reinforce his ideals of inclusivity, demonstrating the importance of how institutions can use their organized power for the greater good. When Matti asks Matteson about traditional relationships, Matteson comments that he can’t always see his choices as binary, whether it be his open marriage, bisexuality, or choosing between two favorites— he believes that picking sides leaves out the middle majority and thus simplifies life too much. I recommend Matti’s article to readers looking for a short, sweet, and confident take on how a man’s bisexuality influences other aspects of his life, and to leave with the takeaway that people must find a way to relate an “oddity” to their own life in order to understand it.</p>

        <p>Identity confusion causes stress, a lack of self-understanding, and a sense of isolation that makes queer spaces feel less inclusive. Recognition and acceptance start small in the language we use, the media we share, the questions we ask, and the care we extend to ourselves and others. Instead of choosing ignorance, you can read, discuss, and spread this bisexual research that humanizes queer people who are often discriminated against. Understanding yourself is a lifelong process shaped by introspection, experimentation, and community. As the sources show, some people find clarity through online or in-person connection, others through logical research, and a few by reflecting on enough life to notice the patterns in their desires. Stay curious and question your certainties— keep track of rising social movements and emerging vocabulary, and take part in the change. People are fluid, the world is fluid, but knowing what drives you and allowing that to shift over time helps to navigate through that ever-changing, confusing plasticity. </p>
